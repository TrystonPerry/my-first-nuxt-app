We're witnessing a world of exponential innovation.

We have the luxury of so many useful inventions.

The internet, search engines, mobile phones, online shopping, chat apps and more.

**We've moved incredibly fast since the internet began.**

And while these tools are incredibly useful,

We've given unprecedented power to **Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and others.**

Regardless of your political opinions on corporations, their goal is to maximize profits.

But that **goal often is misaligned with the goals of the customers** they claim to serve.

But what if it didn't need to be this way?

- What if we could retain the utility of these tools without giving these entities more power?

- What if your privacy was provably respected?

- What if your security was provably respected?

- What if no one could block your access, because you own your data?

- What if the tools did what you wanted and nothing more?

The good news is, there are others out there that want the same as you.

And they build **Free-And-Open-Source (FOSS)** tools for themselves and consequently, for you too.

**Democratized technology is technology in which development is distributed between contributors and not employees at a company.**

Their goals will always align with yours because their vision is motivated by solution rather
than profit.

These people donate their time, to solve their own problems.

Thus, solving _yours_.

You vote with what software you choose to use.

I believe that is called, _a democracy_.

No more vendor lock.

Welcome, to **Democratized.Tech**
